Description: Functionalities to automatically generate interactive visualizations for
             statistical results supported by 'ggfortify', such as time series, PCA,
             clustering and survival analysis, with 'plotly.js' <https://plot.ly/>  and
             'ggplot2' style. The generated visualizations can also be easily extended
             using 'ggplot2' and 'plotly' syntax while staying interactive.
