Title: Automatic Generation of Interactive Visualizations for Popular Statistical Results
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Yuan", "Tang", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "terrytangyuan@gmail.com")
Description: Functionalities to automatically generate interactive visualizations for popular
             statistical results supported by `ggfortify`, such as time series, PCA,
             clustering and survival analysis, with `plotly.js` <https://plot.ly/>  and
             `ggplot2` style. The generated visualizations can also be easily extended
             using `ggplot2` syntax while staying interactive.
